# VRL Labs's `Boilerplates` repo


**Hey, there!**

**We are VRL Labs, and we are passionate about creating tech availiable for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.**

This Repository **Boilerplates** is our personal template collection. Here you'll find templates, and configurations for various tools, and technologies.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

We created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out our [Discord Channel](https://discord.gg/vrl).
